# Learning resources
Hello, don't know how you got here but I'm glad you did. 
This repository is meant to be a personal notebook of learning resources consisting of various IT subjects.
There are already numerous repositories out there similar to this one and you will also find references to some of them here.

Since I'm in a constant process of learning various subjects from the IT industry, consider this repository as a constant work in progress.
You will probably often see me reorganizing it and if you want to have your own personal notebook I encourage you to fork the repo.
